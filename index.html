      <h2>Who Counts as a “Frequent” Card User?</h2>
      <p>
        A frequent card user isn’t just someone with a large balance. It can be a person who uses their card for nearly
        every purchase, from small daily spends to travel and subscriptions, running many transactions through the
        account each month.
      </p>
      <p>
        Issuers pay attention to both volume and pattern: how often you pay, whether you revolve or pay in full, how
        predictable your spending is and whether usage is concentrated with particular merchants or categories.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Issuers Monitor Frequent Spend</h2>
      <p>
        Behind the scenes, card systems track frequency of use as one signal among many. A long history of stable,
        frequent transactions with on-time payments can be a positive indicator, supporting higher limits or smoother
        approvals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sudden spikes in frequency, changes in geography or new merchant patterns may, however, trigger additional
        checks. This does not automatically indicate a problem; it simply reflects that high activity generates more
        data points for risk engines to evaluate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Rewards Potential for High-Activity Users</h2>
      <p>
        Frequent users have more opportunity to earn rewards because more everyday spend flows through the card. Used
        carefully, this can maximise cashback, points or miles compared with paying the same expenses by other means.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, frequent use makes fee structures more important. Foreign transaction charges, surcharges at
        specific merchants and annual fees can add up quickly for high-volume cardholders who are not watching the fine
        print.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Managing Risk, Limits and Cash Flow</h2>
      <p>
        Frequent use increases the importance of understanding your billing cycle, statement dates and grace periods.
        Misjudging timing when many purchases are in motion can create short-term cash flow pressure or lead to interest
        charges that offset rewards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Issuers may periodically adjust limits in response to sustained frequent spending and repayment behaviour.
        Clear communication about these changes, and tools to track upcoming payments, help frequent users stay in
        control.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>When Frequent Use Becomes a Warning Sign</h2>
      <p>
        High usage is not automatically problematic, but certain patterns can attract extra scrutiny: frequent near-limit
        usage, repeated cash-like transactions, unusually dense refund activity or payments that bounce between
        different funding sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cardholders who rely on frequent charging to bridge recurring shortfalls may also face higher interest costs and
        potential stress. Understanding these dynamics early allows for course correction before issues escalate.

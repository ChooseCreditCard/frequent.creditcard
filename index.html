      <h2>What Does “Frequent” Mean in Loyalty Terms?</h2>
      <p>
        In loyalty language, “frequent” usually refers to cardholders who run a large share of their travel and everyday
        spend through one or two key cards. For airline cards this might mean using a co-branded product for flights,
        hotels and daily purchases to collect qualifying miles and points towards status.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programmes distinguish between pure points collectors and frequent flyers or guests who also hold status tiers.
        The card component often acts as an accelerator: extra tier credits, fast-track offers or spend-based
        requalification paths for heavy users.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Frequent Card Spend Feeds Loyalty Programmes</h2>
      <p>
        When you use a co-branded or loyalty-focused credit card, each transaction typically generates two streams of
        value: normal card economics for the issuer, and loyalty currency or tier credits for the programme partner.
        These flows are governed by a commercial agreement between bank and brand.
      </p>
      <p>
        For frequent cardholders, certain thresholds matter more than individual purchases: annual spend targets that
        unlock companion tickets, lounge access, higher earning rates or status extensions. Issuers track these totals
        closely and share relevant data with partner programmes under agreed rules.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Frequent Flyer & Frequent Guest Strategies</h2>
      <p>
        Frequent travellers often combine paid travel activity with card-based earning. A card may:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Top up status-qualifying points when flying less in a given year.</li>
        <li>Offer boosted earning on airline, hotel or travel-agency categories.</li>
        <li>Provide milestone perks (vouchers, upgrades, bonus points) at spend thresholds.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The trade-off is concentration: focusing spend on one ecosystem can unlock strong benefits, but reduces
        flexibility if programme rules, partners or availability change.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>How Issuers View High-Frequency Loyalty Users</h2>
      <p>
        From the issuer perspective, frequent loyalty card users are often attractive if they pay on time and use the
        card widely. Stable, diversified spending across many merchants with predictable repayments can support higher
        limits and targeted offers.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, issuers monitor frequent usage for signs of stress or unusual behaviour: repeated near-limit
        balances, heavy cash-like transactions or abrupt pattern shifts. These signals can trigger tighter controls even
        when the customer is highly engaged with a loyalty programme.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Maximising Value Without Losing Track</h2>
      <p>
        Frequent use amplifies both upside and downside. When card, airline and hotel programmes are aligned with your
        real travel pattern, benefits like lounge access, free nights and priority services can be significant.
      </p>
      <p>
        But high-frequency users also need to manage complexity: multiple billing cycles, varying bonus categories and
        expiry rules for miles and points. Clear dashboards, alerts and basic tracking habits make it easier to avoid
        waste and unintended interest charges.

    <!-- What is “frequent use” in card terms? -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What does “frequent use” mean for a credit card?</h2>
      <p class="small">
        “Frequent use” is not just about having a card in your wallet. It is about how often you tap, swipe
        or use your card online – and how much of your monthly spending flows through one or more cards.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Daily micro-purchases: coffee, transport, subscriptions, small online orders.</li>
        <li>Recurring bills: streaming, phone, utilities and software.</li>
        <li>Heavy card users: most or all spend runs through one main card.</li>
        <li>Frequent flyers and travellers: flights, hotels, rental cars, restaurants on the road.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        For issuers, frequent use is attractive – it generates interchange, FX and sometimes interest.
        For cardholders, frequent use is only a good deal when rewards, limits and fees are aligned with
        real behaviour.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- How frequent card use works in practice -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>How frequent card use affects limits, rewards & risk</h2>
      <p class="small">
        As you use a card more often, a few mechanisms start to matter much more than for occasional users:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Credit limits &amp; utilisation</strong> – high balances relative to your limit can affect
          credit scores and trigger extra checks.</li>
        <li><strong>Reward caps &amp; tiers</strong> – some cards reduce rewards after a threshold or
          push high spenders into better tiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Fraud and risk models</strong> – frequent, predictable patterns can help approvals,
          while unusual bursts can cause declines.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest and carrying a balance</strong> – frequent spend plus unpaid balances magnifies
          interest costs very quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>FX &amp; cross-border</strong> – frequent travellers may hit caps or pay a lot in fees
          if the card is not built for foreign use.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        The more you use a card, the more important it becomes to understand how your specific card treats
        frequent spend – especially rewards, caps, interest and FX.
      </p>

    <!-- Types / models – frequent user profiles -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Common frequent-user card profiles</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Frequent users are not all the same. Some care mostly about miles, others about cashback on groceries
        or predictable business expenses. Here are a few typical profiles:
      </p>

      <div class="cluster-grid">
        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Everyday spenders</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Most or all daily purchases go on one card. Flat-rate or broad-category cashback cards often
            work best here, combined with disciplined full monthly repayment.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Frequent flyers</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Use cards heavily for flights, hotels and travel-related spend. Airline or travel cards with
            strong mileage earning, elite-qualifying benefits and lounge access can dominate.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Category optimisers</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Rotate spend across multiple cards to hit bonus categories: groceries, dining, fuel, online,
            travel and more. Requires more effort but can maximise rewards.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Subscription-heavy users</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Many small recurring payments: SaaS, media, utilities. Reliability of recurring billing,
            virtual cards and good dispute handling are important.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Business &amp; side-hustle spenders</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Use cards frequently for expenses linked to work or a small business. Expense tracking,
            higher limits and business rewards are key.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Heavy revolvers</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Frequent use combined with carrying a balance. For these users, interest rates, fees and
            tools to pay down debt matter more than headline rewards.
